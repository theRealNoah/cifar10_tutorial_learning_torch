Following pytorch example for building image classifier

This is an example of creating a Neural Network Image Classifier from the pyTorch tutorial. 
It is used for learning purposes. 

I changed the width of the network from 6 to 36 and noticed an increase accuracy from 52% to 58%.
This increase in accuracy came at the expense of efficiency and runtime.
